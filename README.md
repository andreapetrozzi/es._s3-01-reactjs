### Description
Job Search Engine

You are tasked with improving an existing project, a remote job search engine.
Today the task is to divide the reducers and improve the cleanliness of the project.

### TASKS:

1. Rewrite your action creators like we did in class,
   writing them in a separate file.
   Replace any type property written as a simple string with a constant.

2. Create two different reducers: one will keep storing the favorites,
   while the other will be reserved to host the array of results deriving from the search.
   To fill this portion of the Redux Store, move the fetch operation into a "special" action creator,
   so as to dispatch the action containing the results only at the end of the asynchronous operation.
.
3. Keep the rest of the features intact,
   and if you haven't already, provide the user with the ability to remove a business from their favorites list.


### Terminal Command:
- `npm i bootstrap@4.6.1`;
- `npm i react-bootstrap@1.6.5`;
- `npm i react-router-dom`;
- `npm i @reduxjs/toolkit`;
- `npm i react-redux`.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
